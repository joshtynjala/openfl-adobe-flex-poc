/**
 *  The LayoutManager is the engine behind
 *  Flex's measurement and layout strategy.
 *  Layout is performed in three phases; commit, measurement, and layout.
 *
 *  <p>Each phase is distinct from the others and all UIComponents of
 *  one phase are processed prior to moving on to the next phase.
 *  During the processing of UIComponents in a phase, requests for
 *  UIComponents to get re-processed by some phase may occur.
 *  These requests are queued and are only processed
 *  during the next run of the phase.</p>
 *
 *  <p>The <b>commit</b> phase begins with a call to
 *  <code>validateProperties()</code>, which walks through a list
 *  (reverse sorted by nesting level) of objects calling each object's
 *  <a href="../core/UIComponent.html#validateProperties()">
 *  <code>validateProperties()</code></a>method.</p>
 *
 *  <p>The objects in the list are processed in reversed nesting order,
 *  with the <b>least</b> deeply nested object accessed first.
 *  This can also be referred to as top-down or outside-in ordering.</p>
 *
 *  <p>This phase allows components whose contents depend on property
 *  settings to configure themselves prior to the measurement
 *  and the layout phases.
 *  For the sake of performance, sometimes a component's property setter
 *  method does not do all the work to update to the new property value.
 *  Instead, the property setter calls the <code>invalidateProperties()</code>
 *  method, deferring the work until this phase runs.
 *  This prevents unnecessary work if the property is set multiple times.</p>
 *
 *  <p>The <b>measurement</b> phase begins with a call to
 *  <code>validateSize()</code>, which walks through a list
 *  (sorted by nesting level) of objects calling each object's
 *  <a href="../core/UIComponent.html#validateSize()"><code>validateSize()</code></a>
 *  method to determine if the object has changed in size.</p>
 *
 *  <p>If an object's <a href="../core/UIComponent.html#invalidateSize()">
 *  <code>invalidateSize()</code></a> method was previously called,
 *  then the <code>validateSize()</code> method is called.
 *  If the size or position of the object was changed as a result of the
 *  <code>validateSize()</code> call, then the object's
 *  <a href="../core/UIComponent.html#invalidateDisplayList()">
 *  <code>invalidateDisplayList()</code></a> method is called, thus adding
 *  the object to the processing queue for the next run of the layout phase.
 *  Additionally, the object's parent is marked for both measurement
 *  and layout phases, by calling
 *  <a href="../core/UIComponent.html#invalidateSize()">
 *  <code>invalidateSize()</code></a> and
 *  <a href="../core/UIComponent.html#invalidateDisplayList()">
 *  <code>invalidateDisplayList()</code></a> respectively.</p>
 *
 *  <p>The objects in the list are processed by nesting order,
 *  with the <b>most</b> deeply nested object accessed first.
 *  This can also be referred to as bottom-up inside-out ordering.</p>
 *
 *  <p>The <b>layout</b> phase begins with a call to the 
 *  <code>validateDisplayList()</code> method, which walks through a list
 *  (reverse sorted by nesting level) of objects calling each object's
 *  <a href="../core/UIComponent.html#validateDisplayList()">
 *  <code>validateDisplayList()</code></a> method to request the object to size
 *  and position all components contained within it (i.e. its children).</p>
 *
 *  <p>If an object's <a href="../core/UIComponent.html#invalidateDisplayList()">
 *  <code>invalidateDisplayList()</code></a> method was previously called,
 *  then <code>validateDisplayList()</code> method for the object is called.</p>
 *
 *  <p>The objects in the list are processed in reversed nesting order,
 *  with the <b>least</b> deeply nested object accessed first.
 *  This can also be referred to as top-down or outside-in ordering.</p>
 *
 *  <p>In general, components do not override the <code>validateProperties()</code>, 
 *  <code>validateSize()</code>, or <code>validateDisplayList()</code> methods.  
 *  In the case of UIComponents, most components override the 
 *  <code>commitProperties()</code>, <code>measure()</code>, or 
 *  <code>updateDisplayList()</code> methods, which are called
 *  by the <code>validateProperties()</code>, 
 *  <code>validateSize()</code>, or 
 *  <code>validateDisplayList()</code> methods, respectively.</p>
 *
 *  <p>At application startup, a single instance of the LayoutManager is created
 *  and stored in the <code>UIComponent.layoutManager</code> property.  
 *  All components are expected to use that instance.  
 *  If you do not have access to the UIComponent object, 
 *  you can also access the LayoutManager using the static 
 *  <code>LayoutManager.getInstance()</code> method.</p>
